DeadZoneTest
============

a quick program for testing different types of deadzone detection

Currently tested to work on Windows and Ouya.  Other platforms supported by XNA and MonoGame would be easy to implement.

Note: This lib uses a couple of submodules, so make sure to run "git submodule init; git submodule update" after cloning.
